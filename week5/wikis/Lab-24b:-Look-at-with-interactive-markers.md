Next you will create an intuitive interface for making Kuri manually look at a desired point. For this you will use [interactive markers](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Interactive%20Markers%3A%20Getting%20Started). You can pick one of the many options for specifying a 3D point to look at from the [Basic Controls tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Interactive%20Markers%3A%20Basic%20Controls). You will need to write a simple interactive marker server that calls the look at service with a new 3D pose every time the pose of the marker is changes through the controls.
