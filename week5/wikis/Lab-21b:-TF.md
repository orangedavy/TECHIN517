## Explore Kuri's frames

TF is an integral part of any ROS-based robot, and the basics of how it works are the same across
all such robots.

Because of this, everything from the Fetch TF tutorial applies to Kuri too. 

Read through and visualize Kuri's frames using the tips and tricks from the Fetch TF lab.

Implement the same demo, but instead of thinking about the gripper, consider which frame will be most
helpful for figuring out where Kuri is looking.
